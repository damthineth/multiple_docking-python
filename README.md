# multiple_docking-python
Hello,
Here I have shown how to do multiple docking using a simple python code.
First of all, you should create 5 new folders named;
  protein: protein in pdbqt format 
  all: all the ligands in pdbqt format
  output: that is the place where all the outputs are generated by executing create_output.py
  logs: that is the place where all the log files are generated by executing create_output.py
  config: that is the place where all the configuration files are generated by executing create_config.py
  
except to those 5 folders, there should be 2 .py files(create_output.py and create_config.py), vina, and vina_split.

Note: sometimes it doesn't work. That case, you have to run docking.sh file instead.
